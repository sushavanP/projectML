I took 200 frequent mall customers and looked at their history of spending at the mall and calculated their spending score from 1 - 100, 100 being the highest score by looking at their amount of spending. I then also looked at their yearly income in USD, and then built my model using the hierarchical clustering algoritm and separated them into 5 clusters.
This clusters would help the sales team of the mall to target their customers and increase their sales.
